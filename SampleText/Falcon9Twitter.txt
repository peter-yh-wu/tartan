spacehistory repeats itself as the SpaceX FalconHeavy and Falcon9 stand ready for launch at the NASA Kennedy Center just like STS-400/125 and Skylab Saturns before. Can't wait for tuesday!

LIFTOFF! Did you see the Falcon9 rocket launch just a few minutes ago?

LAUNCH!!! A SpaceX Falcon9 lifts off from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station carrying the Government Sat1.

Watching a rocket launch from your front yard is cool. Watching it through the eyes of your children? Even better.
